        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Hyegin Cho. I am a recent UC Davis grad who studied statistics.<br/> I am currently working as a logistics coordinator for a supply chain company. <br/> I grew up in Morgan Hill, CA which is right below San Jose, CA. <br/> Since I was surrounded by technology growing up, I naturally became interested in them. <br/> Morgan Hill was interesting because it is close to the city but it is also nature friendly.<br/> The above picture of Woodland Acres is the enterance to my childhood neighborhood.<br/> When I get bored, I often code on the side. Unlike many developers who found out coding when they are young, I found out that I can code to create websites last year.<br/> Ever since then, I fell in love with the beauty of it.</p>

        <h1>Recent Experience</h1>
        <p>This past tax season, I volunteered as an income tax preparer and filed taxes for individuals who generally made $54,000 or less for free. It was extremely rewarding to see people who greatly appreciated my work. I currently work as a computer room consultant where I work as front end IT helper at UC Davis. I really enjoy my campus job since I get to work with lots of technology. </p>
