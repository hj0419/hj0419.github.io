		<h2>Student Data Analyst</h2>
		<h2>Hello, I am Hyegin and I am a student data analyst.<br/> I am a current senior college student at UC Davis majoring in applied statisitcs. <br/> I first got into statistics because I believe numbers are beautiful.<br/> Numbers are universal and they can be understood in any country.<br/> I went to elementary school in South Korea until 2006.<br/> In 2006, I transferred to a school in American military base in Korea. <br/>I could not understand anything on the board for a while because of language transition. <br/> However, numbers were different. <br/> I excelled in math classes because it did not require me to be perfect in English. <br/> I fell in love with numbers since then. <br/> Thank you for visiting my page.</h2>
