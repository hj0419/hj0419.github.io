<h3>Aspiring Web and Data Magician</h3>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p id="first">
Hello All! My name is Hyegin and I am a recent college graduate who graduated from UC Davis. I majored in statistics with emphasis in economics. 
</p>

<h2>Why did you choose to study statistics in college?</h2>
<p>
I chose statistics as my major because I love numbers. It's that simple. It may have been nicer to have a route of where I was heading with the degree from the beginning, but that wasn't me. I just majored something I always enjoyed since I was young.
</p>

<h2>Why didn't you do lots of internships in college?</h2>
<p>
That is one of my regrets since I did not know the importance of internships back in college. I spent the summers having fun with my family and friends rather than spending time to advance my skills. However, I am trying harder now, so I don't think that's an issue.
</p>

<h2>What is your plan for your future?</h2>
<p>
  Hmm.. That is a difficult one. I want to always learn and better myself. It doesn't have to be specific industry. I enjoy coding these days, so I may try to code more. It could be opeartions since I did operations internship and my current job is in operations. Or, it could be both! Nowadays, operations departments need people who can code. But, we will see how it goes.
</p>

<h2>What do you do for fun?</h2>
<p>
  For fun I code these days. I used to watch Netflix a lot in college, but after I graduated, I value my time a lot more than before. Time is precious, and I want to make good use out of it.
</p>

<h2>What are your best qualities?</h2>
<p>
  I would say I am resilient. I can overcome hardships and become stronger. I can learn various things fast and efficiently. I am also adaptable to most places. I love challenges because they make me more knowledgeable.
